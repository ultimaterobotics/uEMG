# uEMG - 4-channel EMG device
This repository contains PCB design, firmware and PC program for analysing data (that one has hardly readable code for now, it's a work in progress with thousands lines of code dedicated to various signal processing approaches with only small part of them used in current version)

Firmware is in relatively good state. It depends on our nrf library: https://github.com/ultimaterobotics/urf_lib and requires bootloader: https://github.com/ultimaterobotics/uECG_bootloader
